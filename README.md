# Test project for AWS CDK using CDK [Java Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java.html) with some other change and tests
# Welcome to your CDK Java project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkWorkshopStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`                compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`                     list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`                  emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`                 deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`                   compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`                   open CDK documentation
 * `cdk deploy --hotswap`       speed up that deployment time (dev)
 * `cdk watch`                  it monitors your code and assets for changes

Enjoy!
